# Hi there, I'm Atakan ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m an MSc student in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, focused on bioinformatics research, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases. My current work centers on alternative splicing analysis using RNA-seq data to identify novel biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. In addition, I am actively contributing to fields such as Computational Drug Discovery, Genomics, and Transcriptomics, leveraging Machine Learning to enhance bioinformatics analyses. I also develop custom bioinformatics tools and web applications to streamline data processing and visualization for diverse research projects.
